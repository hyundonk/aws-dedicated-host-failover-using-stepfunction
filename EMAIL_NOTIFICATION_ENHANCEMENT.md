# Email Notification Enhancement Summary

## Overview

Enhanced the EC2 Dedicated Host Failover solution to provide detailed instance-level information in email notifications instead of just basic summary information.

## Problem Statement

**Before**: Email notifications only contained basic information:
```
Successfully migrated all instances from dedicated host h-0e2e58fd82f8fd04c to h-0a2d4fda63c688801. Migration summary: 2 total instances, 2 successful, 0 failed.
```

**After**: Email notifications now include comprehensive instance-level details with rich formatting.

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Lambda Function: PrepareDetailedNotificationFunction

**Location**: `lib/lambda/prepare-detailed-notification/index.js`

**Features**:
- Retrieves complete migration record from DynamoDB
- Generates rich, formatted email messages with emojis and clear sections
- Calculates migration durations and formats timestamps
- Provides different message types for various scenarios
- Includes actionable recommendations for failures

**Input Parameters**:
- `hostId`: The host ID for the migration
- `notificationType`: Type of notification (success, failure, partial)
- `failedInstances`: Array of failed instance IDs (optional)
- `customMessage`: Custom message override (optional)
- `errorMessage`: Error message for provision failures (optional)

### 2. Updated Step Functions Workflow

**Modified States**:
- `PrepareSuccessMessage`: Now calls PrepareDetailedNotificationFunction
- `PrepareFailureMessage`: Enhanced with detailed instance information
- `PrepareProvisionFailureMessage`: Uses detailed notification function
- `SendNoInstancesNotification`: Enhanced formatting for no-instances scenario

**Changes Made**:
- Replaced simple Pass states with Lambda function calls
- Added proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced SNS message formatting with subject and message separation

### 3. Updated CDK Stack

**Additions**:
- New Lambda function definition for PrepareDetailedNotificationFunction
- Proper IAM permissions for DynamoDB read access
- Step Functions integration permissions
- CloudFormation outputs for new resources
